<h1> Overview </h1>
<p> PulsePay API demonstrates just a tip of the iceberg on how an API is built and various functionalities an API can have. </p>

<p> Production APIs have other features like secure login, token limits, Analytics etc. In a banking API these features are ideal for optimal user experience and for efficient bank operations.</p>

<p> In the problem statement. A school XYZ, hypothetically named as Brainly University needs to integrate an API on its payment platform. But first the school needs to design a robust relational database that represents its merchants database at the API server end.

<p>This is an ERD diagram representing the proposed Database Schema for Brainly University</p>

I am also working on a web app simulating the API process in HTML, JS, and Python Flask. Head over to the brainly-flask-app to check its progress
