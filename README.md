<p id="description">Brainly University has developed a fee payment portal application that will facilitate fee payments for students enrolled in the university. Brainly needs to integrate the app with its merchant account at family bank.. The Bank needs to source its API to the school. This is an approach on how the bank can design its API around this using FastAPI and Python.</p>

<p id="description">The project requires a relational database. PostgreSQL was used for this as it offers great relationalfeatures and it is open source. Refer to Getting started in the links on how to installPostgres on your machine.</p>
